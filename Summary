üè• Project Overview
This project delves into analyzing insurance data from MediBuddy, a digital healthcare platform. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights from personal and insurance-related data to enhance decision-making processes within the healthcare insurance domain.
GitHub

üéØ Key Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Identify patterns and trends that can inform policy decisions and customer segmentation.
Develop predictive models to forecast insurance claim probabilities or customer behaviors.

üß∞ Methodology
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Utilized datasets such as Medibuddy Insurance Data Price.csv and Medibuddy insurance data personal details.xlsx.
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features to prepare the data for analysis.
GitHub

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Employed visualization tools to uncover correlations between variables like age, insurance premiums, and claim history.
Analyzed demographic distributions to identify key customer segments.
RPubs

Model Development:
Implemented machine learning algorithms, possibly including logistic regression or decision trees, to predict outcomes such as claim likelihood.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves.

üìà Key Findings
Certain demographic factors, such as age and occupation, significantly influence insurance claim probabilities.
Identified high-risk customer segments that could benefit from targeted interventions or policy adjustments.
The predictive models demonstrated satisfactory performance, indicating their potential utility in real-world applications.
